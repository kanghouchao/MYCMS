# Contributing Guide

The goal of this document is to make contributions safe, reviewable, and fast to ship. The emphasis is on clear human-reviewed changes and high-quality code.

Keep changes small and focused. If a change touches more than one area (frontend/backend/environment), prefer separate pull requests.

## Quick checklist (before opening a PR)

- Build: project builds locally (see "Try locally" below).
- Lint / format: run linters and formatters for the affected area.
- Tests: unit tests for the changed area pass and new behavior is covered by tests.
- Smoke: include a short validation checklist in the PR description for reviewers.
- PR size: prefer smaller PRs that are easy to review (one logical change per PR).

## Try locally (minimal reproducible steps)

You should install Docker and Docker Buildx to run the full stack locally. The Makefile provides common commands.

Before opening a PR it's helpful to run a minimal local validation to save reviewers time. Example quick steps (copy/paste):

- Build & tests:

```bash
make test build
```

- Start full stack for manual smoke checks (requires Docker/Buildx):

```bash
make up
```

## Local development & useful commands

This repository uses Make targets and Docker for local development. Common commands (run from the repository root):

- Build all images: make build service=frontend|backend
- Start local stack: make up
- Show running containers: make ps
- Follow logs for a service: make logs service=backend|frontend|traefik|database
- Run tests for a service: make test service=frontend|backend
- Lint or format: make lint service=frontend|backend
- Format: make format service=frontend|backend
- Stop and remove containers: make down
- (be careful!) Clean all containers, volumes, images: make clean service=frontend|backend

Notes:
- When you are not specifying service=..., the command applies to both frontend and backend, or all services(e.g. `make logs`).
- Frontend dev server: `frontend/` uses Next.js (run `npm run dev` inside `frontend` for a typical dev workflow).
- Backend build/test: use the Gradle wrapper in `backend/` (e.g. `./gradlew build` or `./gradlew test`).
	- On Windows PowerShell use `gradlew.bat build` or `gradlew.bat test`.
	- Alternatively use WSL for a POSIX-like environment and run `./gradlew ...` there.

Spec Kit branch naming rule
-------------------------

If you use Spec Kit tooling (the repository ships specs under `.specs/` or `.specify/`), follow the feature-branch naming convention enforced by the Spec Kit helper function `check_feature_branch` located in `.specify/scripts/bash/common.sh`.

Concretely: feature branches MUST begin with a three-digit numeric prefix followed by a hyphen, for example `001-my-feature` or `123-add-auth`. The helper validates branch names with the regexp `^[0-9]{3}-` and will print an error and exit if the branch name doesn't match. If you don't follow this rule, Spec Kit scripts (or other automation that relies on the helper) will fail during execution.

When creating a new feature branch, ensure your branch name matches the pattern and run `git status --porcelain` to ensure your working tree is clean before running Spec Kit scripts.

## Code quality and style

High-quality code is essential. Follow these conventions:

- Keep functions and components small and focused.
- Add unit tests for new logic and bug fixes. If a change touches security or data migrations, include an integration or smoke test where practical.
- Avoid large formatting-only changes in the same PR as functional changes.
- Follow existing project style: backend uses Spotless + Google Java Format; frontend uses ESLint.
- Run linters and formatters before opening a PR.

Commit message guidance:

- Use present-tense, short summary in the first line (<= 72 chars).
- Provide a short description body if the change is non-trivial.
- Reference the issue number when applicable (e.g., `Closes #123`).

## Tests & Coverage (repeat)

- Frontend: Jest, Testing Library; put tests under `frontend/src/**/__tests__/**`.
- Backend: JUnit; generate Jacoco report to `backend/build/reports/jacoco`.

## Quality gates

Before requesting review, please ensure the following (CI will also verify these):

1. Build passes for the affected service(s).
2. Lint/Typecheck (frontend) and code format (backend Spotless) pass.
3. Unit tests for the affected service(s) pass; add tests for new behavior.
4. Include a short smoke validation list in the PR description.
5. Coverage: maintain at least 70% line coverage for unit tests (CI enforces a 70% gate).

Coverage targets are enforced in CI; aim to keep changes well tested and add tests for new behavior.

Notes on coverage enforcement:

- Frontend: Jest's config (`frontend/jest.config.cjs`) enables `collectCoverage` and a global coverageThreshold (lines: 70). Running `npm test` will fail if thresholds are not met — CI runs the same tests.
- Backend: Jacoco is configured in `backend/build.gradle` and the Gradle `check` task depends on `jacocoTestCoverageVerification`. The project is configured to enforce a minimum 70% line coverage (excludes generated/build directories). CI runs the backend test stage via the Dockerfile, which invokes the Gradle test and coverage verification steps; failures will fail the CI job.

## Repo conventions and important paths

- Frontend source: `frontend/src/` (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Frontend middleware: `frontend/src/middleware.ts` — host/tenant resolution and cookies
- Shared HTTP client (frontend): `frontend/src/lib/client.ts`
- Frontend server components (tenant templates): `frontend/src/app/tenant/templates/`
- Backend Java: `backend/src/main/java/com/cms/`
- Backend changelogs/migrations: `backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/`
- Makefile and Docker compose at repo root control local orchestration.

Architecture reminders:

- Traefik routes `/api/*` to the backend and strips the prefix before it reaches Spring Boot.
- Backend namespaces: `/central/*` (admin) and `/tenant/*` (tenant).
- Tenant selection is host-based; middleware sets cookies consumed by server components (`x-mw-role`, `x-mw-tenant-id`, `x-mw-tenant-name`, `x-mw-tenant-template`). Server components should read these via `cookies()`.

## PR workflow and review checklist

When opening a PR, include:

**You can use the template in [here](.github/pull_request_template.md)**

Note: the repository has a CI check that validates PR bodies contain required sections (Context & Motivation, Scope of Changes, Quality Gates, Test Notes, Risk & Mitigation). Omitting those headings will cause the PR template check to fail in CI.

- A short summary of what changed and why.
- The commands used to validate locally (build/test/lint).
- A short smoke checklist for reviewers (what to click/observe, basic expected behavior).
- Any DB migration or infra changes, including rollout and rollback notes.
- Tests added/updated and where they live.


Reviewers will check:

- Does the change have tests (or a good rationale if not)?
- Is the change small and focused enough to review?
- Are linters and formatters satisfied?
- Any security or infra impact clearly documented?

## Optional: AI-assisted contributions

AI tools may be used to help draft code, tests, or documentation, but all AI-assisted changes must be carefully reviewed by a human before merging. If you used AI assistance, it is helpful (but not required) to note that in the PR and include a brief summary of how the output was validated.

Suggested minimal note (optional): "Parts of this PR were drafted with AI assistance; I reviewed and adjusted the generated code and added tests to cover behavior X."

Thanks for contributing!
