# Phase 2 — Tasks

Path: `/Users/kanghouchao/CodeProjects/cms/specs/001-dependabot-updates/tasks.md`

Priority ordering (TDD + safety-first)

1. [Research] Spike: automation feasibility — enumerate required tests, CI checks, and permissions for safe bot-driven force-pushes. (owner: maintainer)
2. [Doc] Finalize operator quickstart and add a short checklist template to use in PR comments. (owner: maintainer)
3. [Tooling] Create a reproducible script `scripts/rebase-and-verify.sh` (no force-push by default) that performs fetch, rebase, run-tests, and reports status. Add unit/cli tests for the script. (owner: maintainer)
4. [Tests] Add integration test harness to reproduce a sample dependency bump PR and assert rebase+CI expectations (failing tests created first). (owner: dev)
5. [CI] Define a safety gate in GitHub Actions: require status checks (unit/integration) to pass before allowing merge. Document in PR template. (owner: devops)
6. [Automation Spike] If Spike (1) indicates safe automation possible, create a bot-run workflow that uses the tested script and runs in a dry-run mode first (no force-push). (owner: dev)
7. [Automation] Add gradual rollout for bot: start with a scheduled workflow that posts a comment with suggested rebase result and requires a human to confirm merge. (owner: dev)
8. [Cleanup] After processing all target PRs, close coordinator branch `001-dependabot-updates` and document completed actions in the coordinating PR. (owner: maintainer)

Estimated total: 8 tasks. Re-evaluate after Spike.
