## Goal
Triage and safely merge Dependabot PRs that update dependencies across frontend, backend and CI workflows while minimizing CI failures and runtime regressions.

## Risk classification
- Low-risk (patch/minor library upgrades, no breaking changes expected): PRs 33 (axios), 34 (tailwind minor->major? see note), 32, 30, 31 (testing libs) — these primarily change `frontend/package.json`. Still require running frontend tests and a local dev build.
- Medium-risk (tooling/workflow upgrades): PRs 28,27,26,25 (GitHub Actions updates) — may require runner updates (note: v5 actions often require runner v2.327.1+). Check self-hosted runner compatibility or update runners.
- Medium-high risk (build plugin major version): PR #29 (spotless 6->7) — check plugin compatibility with Gradle/Java versions and run `./gradlew spotlessApply` and `./gradlew check` locally.

Notes:
- Tailwind 3.x -> 4.x may include breaking changes; review Tailwind migration notes. Mark as medium-risk until reviewed.

## Phased plan (safe, checklist-driven)
Phase A — Triage (owner: @repo-maintainer)
- For each PR:
  - Review release notes linked in the PR body.
  - Check compatibility score badges (Dependabot) and any linked breaking-change notes.
  - Run a local smoke test or unit tests for the affected area.
  - Add a comment on the PR with triage result: `triage/ok` or `triage/requires-manual-review`.
- Estimated time: 15–30 minutes per PR for frontend deps; 30–60 minutes for backend/workflow PRs.

Phase B — Automated test & CI validation (owner: CI runner)
- For frontend PRs (33,34,32,31,30):
  - Create a dedicated CI run that executes: `npm ci` in `frontend`, build Next app, run unit tests (`npm test`), run lint and type-check.
  - If CI passes, request `@dependabot merge` or use GitHub API to `squash and merge` these PRs.
- For backend PR #29:
  - Run `./gradlew build` and `./gradlew spotlessCheck` locally in `backend` and in CI job.
  - If build passes, merge.
- For GitHub Actions updates (25–28):
  - Verify runner versions in organization or hosted runner compatibility; if using GitHub-hosted runners, ensure minimum version requirement is satisfied.
  - Create a test workflow run on a branch to validate.

Phase C — Merge & monitor (owner: @repo-maintainer)
- Merge low-risk PRs first (frontend testing libs, axios) after CI green.
- Merge backend plugin once spotless and build pass.
- Merge actions/workflows last; consider merging one workflow PR at a time and immediately monitoring CI run results.
- After each merge, watch main CI (CodeQL, build) for regressions for at least 1 hour.

Phase D — Rollback plan
- If a merged PR causes failing CI or runtime regressions, revert the merge commit quickly and open an incident issue.
- Keep a recorded backup branch for safe rollbacks.

## Automation commands (copyable)
# Fetch PRs and run local tests for a given PR branch
# Replace <PR_BRANCH> with the head ref (example: dependabot/npm_and_yarn/frontend/axios-tw-1.12.2)

git fetch origin <PR_BRANCH>:tmp/pr-branch
git checkout tmp/pr-branch
# Frontend
(cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && npm test)
# Backend
(cd backend && ./gradlew clean build)

# Merge via Dependabot command (if CI green)
# Comment on PR: @dependabot squash and merge

## Acceptance criteria
- All dependabot PRs are either merged or marked with a blocker/issue explaining why not.
- CI remains green on `master` for at least 1 hour after merges.
- No runtime regressions observed in staging if available.

## Next steps (who does what)
- @repo-maintainer: Complete Phase A triage for PRs #34–#25.
- @repo-maintainer: Run Phase B CI runs (or trigger re-runs) and post results as PR comments.
- @repo-maintainer: Merge low-risk PRs after CI success and monitor.
