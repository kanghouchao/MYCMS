# Feature Specification: Dependabot PR rebase & merge workflow

**Feature Branch**: `001-001-dependabot-updates`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "我现在在001-dependabot-updates分支上，这个分支的本意是解决现在由dependabot扫描而自动创建的所有pr，这不是开发任务，只是要将由dependabot创建的pr对应的分支下载检查然后rebase main分支，再force提交，然后合并pr，为了规范操作这个任务也创建了pr，并引入了并实验spec-kit的运行，完成dependabot创建的任务之后，再关闭当前分支"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT needs to be done and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement low-level details (but this spec documents the operational steps required)
- 👥 Written for maintainers who will perform the dependabot rebase/merge operations

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a repository maintainer, I want to process all dependabot-created PR branches by rebasing them onto `main`, force-pushing the rebased branch, and merging the PRs so that automated dependency updates are applied cleanly and in a consistent, auditable manner. After processing, I want the helper branch used for coordinating these tasks to be closed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a dependabot PR with a branch `dependabot/...`, **When** the maintainer checks out that branch and rebases onto `main`, **Then** the branch history is rebased with no unrelated commits and the maintainer can force-push to update the PR.
2. **Given** multiple dependabot PRs, **When** each is processed in sequence, **Then** each PR is merged and tests/CI pass (or failures are documented), and the coordination branch `001-001-dependabot-updates` remains solely as a coordinator which will be closed at the end.

### Edge Cases
- What if a rebase produces conflicts? See FR-003 for conflict handling.
- What if CI fails after merge? CI policy in repo applies; maintainers must document remediation steps.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System/maintainer MUST checkout dependabot PR branches locally to inspect and run tests before rebasing.
- **FR-002**: Maintainer MUST rebase the dependabot branch onto the latest `main` and force-push the branch to update the PR.
- **FR-003**: If a rebase results in merge conflicts, the maintainer MUST document the conflict, attempt to resolve it if trivial, and if not resolvable quickly, post a comment on the PR and skip to the next PR.
- **FR-004**: After force-push, the maintainer MUST ensure CI runs and passes for the rebased branch before merging; if CI fails, the PR is not merged until fixed or an approval is recorded with risk justification.
- **FR-005**: The coordinating branch `001-001-dependabot-updates` MUST be used only for orchestration and closed once all target dependabot PRs have been processed.

*Ambiguities / Clarifications*:
- **FR-006**: Does the team want a fully automated flow (bot) or manual operator workflow? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: automation desired?]

### Key Entities *(if applicable)*
- **Dependabot PR**: a pull request created by Dependabot containing dependency updates.
- **Coordinator Branch**: `001-001-dependabot-updates` used to coordinate the manual tasks and experiments with spec-kit.
